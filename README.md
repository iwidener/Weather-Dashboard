# Weather-Dashboard
As a traveler 
I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
so that I can plan a trip accordingly.

The weather data for cities is retrieved from OpenWeather API. The app runs in the browser. 
Enter any city name in the search box and it will display the following under current weather conditions: city, date, icon image (visual representation of weather conditions), temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. 

A 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions are included. Each day for the 5-Day Forecast displays the following: date, icon image (visual representation of weather conditions), temperature, humidity.

A search history allows the users to access their past search terms. Clicking on the city name will perform a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city.
